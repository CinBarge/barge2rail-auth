## Dependency Management Best Practices Observed

### ✅ Requirements Pinned
All dependencies in `requirements.txt` have exact version pins:
```
Django==4.2.24
urllib3==2.5.0
GitPython==3.1.43
```

### ✅ Virtual Environment Isolated
- Using `.venv` for dependency isolation
- `.venv` properly excluded from git

### ✅ Regular Updates
- Dependencies recently updated (October 2025)
- Security patches applied promptly

---

## Recommendations

### For Ongoing Security
1. **Monthly Scans:** Run `safety scan` monthly (new command replacing `check`)
2. **Automated Monitoring:** Consider GitHub Dependabot for automatic security alerts
3. **Update Strategy:**
   - **Critical/High:** Update immediately
   - **Medium:** Update within 30 days
   - **Low:** Update during regular maintenance

### Action Items
- [ ] **RECOMMENDED:** Add Dependabot to GitHub repository
- [ ] **RECOMMENDED:** Set up monthly dependency review calendar reminder
- [ ] **RECOMMENDED:** Migrate from `safety check` to `safety scan` (new command)
