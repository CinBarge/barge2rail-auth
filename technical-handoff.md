- User Count: 4 × 2 = 8
- Business Impact: 5 × 3 = 15
- Complexity: 5 × 1 = 5
- Integration Points: 5 × 2 = 10
- **TOTAL: 53/60**

### Capacity Assessment:
- **Time Available:** 3-5 hours/week (limited)
- **Mental Load:** Manageable but stressed
- **Interruptions:** Frequent (daily)
- **Assessment:** Marginal capacity for HIGH RISK
- **Result:** ✅ Successfully managed with HIGH RISK protocol

### Prerequisites Status:
- ✅ HIGH RISK protocol followed completely
- ✅ Three-perspective security review completed
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (40 tests, 100% pass rate)

## Rollback Plan

### Current State
- ✅ Git history preserved (easy rollback)
- ✅ Environment variables documented
- ✅ Render service can be redeployed from any commit
- ✅ DNS can be reverted to old system if needed

### Rollback Procedure
**If critical issue discovered:**

1. **Immediate (< 5 minutes):**
   - Disable custom domain in Render (revert to old auth system)
   - Or: Redeploy previous git commit via Render dashboard

2. **Full Rollback (< 15 minutes):**
   ```bash
   # Identify last good commit
   git log --oneline
   
   # Redeploy from specific commit in Render dashboard
   # Settings → Redeploy → Select commit
   ```

3. **Post-Rollback:**
   - Document what went wrong
   - Fix issue in development
   - Re-test completely
   - Redeploy when ready

### Rollback Authority
- **Clif** has final authority to trigger rollback
- **The Bridge** can recommend rollback based on monitoring
- **Automatic rollback:** Not configured (manual process)

2. Run cleanup commands (old login attempts, expired sessions)
3. Check SSL certificate expiration (auto-renews, but verify)
4. Update dependencies if security patches available
5. Review performance metrics

### Monthly Tasks
1. Audit active users and access patterns
2. Review and update documentation
3. Check for Django/DRF security updates
4. Test rollback procedure
5. Update post-mortem with learnings

## Lessons Learned (Preliminary)

### What Worked Well
1. ✅ HIGH RISK protocol caught all critical issues before deployment
2. ✅ Three-perspective review identified 17 issues systematically
3. ✅ Comprehensive test suite (40 tests) provided confidence
4. ✅ Claude Code fixed all issues efficiently
5. ✅ Deployment process was smooth and fast (~2 hours)
6. ✅ Zero production incidents on first deployment

### What to Improve
1. ⏳ Test suite should be created earlier in development cycle
2. ⏳ Environment variable documentation could be more detailed
3. ⏳ Rollback procedure should be tested before deployment
4. ⏳ Staff training should begin earlier

### Framework Validation
**The Bridge HIGH RISK protocol works:**
- Systematic risk assessment prevented rushing
- Multiple AI perspectives caught issues humans might miss
- Functional testing provided non-technical verification
- Chunked deployment made complex work manageable
- Documentation preserved institutional knowledge

**Recommendation:** Use this exact process for future HIGH RISK deployments
