## Risk Assessment

**Date:** October 4, 2025  
**Assessed By:** Clif (via The Bridge)  
**Risk Score:** 53/60  
**Risk Level:** HIGH RISK  
**Decision:** CONDITIONAL GO

### Risk Factors:
- Data Criticality: 5 × 3 = 15
- User Count: 4 × 2 = 8
- Business Impact: 5 × 3 = 15
- Complexity: 5 × 1 = 5
- Integration Points: 5 × 2 = 10
- **TOTAL: 53/60**

### Capacity Assessment:
- **Time Available:** 3-5 hours/week (limited)
- **Mental Load:** Manageable but stressed
- **Interruptions:** Frequent (daily)
- **Assessment:** Marginal capacity for HIGH RISK

### Prerequisites Status:
- ❌ 6+ months MEDIUM RISK experience (first project)
- ⚠️ External review (consider before final cutover)
- ⏳ Full backup/restore (to be implemented)
- ⏳ Real-time monitoring (to be configured)
- ⏳ 2-month parallel operation (extended from 1 month)
- ⏳ Staff training (to be created)
- ⏳ Business continuity plan (to be documented)

### Decision Rationale:
**CONDITIONAL GO** because:
1. Foundational system - must be built eventually
2. Significant work already completed
3. The Bridge framework provides systematic safety
4. Technical aptitude + AI assistance available
5. Real business need

### Mandatory Mitigations:
1. ✅ Use full HIGH RISK protocol
2. ✅ Extended parallel operation (2 months)
3. ✅ Intensive Bridge oversight
4. ✅ Multiple AI perspectives for every change
5. ✅ Comprehensive functional testing
6. ✅ Rollback plan tested multiple times
7. ⚠️ Consider external review before production
8. ✅ Heavy Galactica documentation
9. ✅ 15-minute work chunks
10. ✅ No time pressure

---

## Deployment Status

### Render Service
- **Status:** Not created yet
- **Prerequisite Work:** Complete ✅
  - Dockerfile exists
  - render.yaml exists
  - Repository cleaned

### Environment Configuration
**Required variables (production):**
```
BASE_URL=https://sso.barge2rail.com
DEBUG=False
ALLOWED_HOSTS=sso.barge2rail.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<PROD_ID>.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<PROD_SECRET>
```

### DNS/Domain
- **Domain:** sso.barge2rail.com
- **Platform:** Render (custom domain + auto-SSL)
- **Status:** Not configured yet

### OAuth Configuration
- **Provider:** Google Workspace
- **Endpoint:** v2 (using latest OAuth)
- **Authorized Redirect URIs:**
  - http://127.0.0.1:8000/auth/google/callback/ (dev)
  - http://localhost:8000/auth/google/callback/ (dev)
  - https://sso.barge2rail.com/auth/google/callback/ (prod - to be added)

---

## Blockers & Dependencies

### Current Blockers
1. ⏳ Render service creation (manual step)
2. ⏳ Production OAuth redirect URI registration
3. ⏳ Database migrations in production
4. ⏳ Static files collection in production
5. ⏳ Custom domain DNS configuration

### Dependencies
**Blocks these projects:**
- PrimeTrade integration (waiting for SSO)
- Intern database consolidation project
- All future barge2rail systems

**Depends on:**
- Google Workspace (external)
- Render platform (external)
- Domain DNS (HostPapa)

---

## Testing Strategy

### Functional Tests (To Be Created)
**Test Suite Needed:**
1. OAuth login flow
2. Session management
3. Token refresh
4. Logout functionality
5. Error handling
6. Redirect URI behavior

**Test Format:** Non-technical person can execute
**Coverage Required:** 100% for authentication paths

### Quality Gates (HIGH RISK)
**Every code change requires:**
1. Security review (independent AI)
2. Data safety review (different AI)
3. Business logic review (third perspective)
4. All reviews must have HIGH confidence
5. The Bridge approval before merge

### Deployment Testing
**HIGH RISK Protocol:**
- Pre-deployment checklist (comprehensive)
- Rollback plan created and tested multiple times
- 2-month parallel operation
- Daily monitoring and verification
- Weekly team check-ins

---

## Rollback Plan

### Current State
- ⚠️ No formal rollback plan yet
- ⚠️ No backup system in place

### Required Before Deployment
1. Document exact rollback steps
2. Test rollback procedure multiple times
3. Verify rollback completion time < 15 minutes
4. Create rollback decision tree
5. Assign rollback authority

---

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success
- [ ] OAuth login works reliably
- [ ] Session management stable
- [ ] Token refresh automatic
- [ ] All functional tests pass
- [ ] Zero security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Performance acceptable

### Business Success
- [ ] All staff can authenticate
- [ ] PrimeTrade integration unblocked
- [ ] Zero data loss or breaches
- [ ] Rollback plan exists and tested
- [ ] Patterns documented for future

### Framework Validation
- [ ] Risk assessment proved accurate
- [ ] Quality gates caught real issues
- [ ] Deployment protocol prevented problems
- [ ] Learning loop documented lessons
- [ ] Confidence gained for future HIGH RISK work

---

## Timeline (Estimated)

### Phase 1: Safety Infrastructure (1-2 weeks)
- Week 1-2: Quality gates, functional tests, rollback plan

### Phase 2: Render Deployment (1-2 weeks)
- Week 3-4: Create service, configure, initial deployment, testing

### Phase 3: Parallel Operation (2 months)
- Month 2-3: Production deployment, intensive monitoring, validation

### Phase 4: Post-Mortem (1 week)
- Week 13: Comprehensive review, pattern documentation, framework updates

**Total Estimated Timeline:** 3-4 months (conservative)

**Note:** No time pressure. Better to take longer and succeed than rush and fail.

- **Found:** 17 issues total (6 CRITICAL, 6 HIGH, 5 MEDIUM)
- **Status:** ❌ DEPLOYMENT BLOCKED - Critical issues must be fixed
- **Validated:** The Bridge framework works as designed
- **Created:** FUNCTIONAL_TESTS.md (10 executable tests)
- **Decision:** Pause to digest findings before proceeding with fixes
- **Next:** Review findings, choose approach (fix issues vs clarify business logic)

### October 4, 2025 - Evening Session  
- **FIXED:** Critical Issue #1 - Tokens exposed in URL redirect
- **Implementation:** Secure two-step token exchange pattern
