# Django SSO Deployment - Galactica Integration Ready

## Current Status Capture
```bash
memory remember "Django SSO ready for Render deployment. PRs merged: Dockerfile, render.yaml, claude.md. Next: Create Render service + production env vars. Working dir: /Users/cerion/Projects/barge2rail-auth" --tags django,deployment,status --importance 8
```

## Pre-Deployment Context Preparation
```bash
# Capture context for AI conversations
memory context --relevant-to "Django SSO deployment blockers" --copy
# Context now in clipboard - paste into Claude conversations
```

## Deployment Commands with UMS Integration

### Check PR Status
```bash
cd /Users/cerion/Projects/barge2rail-auth
git branch -a
git status
# Important outcomes will be automatically captured via clipboard
```

### Log Key Decisions
```bash
# After merging PRs
memory remember "PRs merged successfully. Django SSO prep work complete. Ready for Render service creation." --tags django,deployment,milestone --importance 8

# After Render service creation  
memory remember "Render service created for Django SSO. Environment vars configured. URL: sso.barge2rail.com" --tags django,render,production --importance 9
```

## Emergency Recovery Protocol
If interrupted during deployment:
```bash
memory ask "What was the next step for Django deployment?"
memory search "Django deployment" --since "today" --limit 5
memory context --relevant-to "Django SSO blockers" --copy
```
