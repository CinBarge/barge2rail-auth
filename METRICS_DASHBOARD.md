# Metrics Dashboard - Framework Performance Tracking
**Version 1.0 - October 2025**  
**Peer Review Enhancement #9**

## Purpose

**Track framework effectiveness with lightweight metrics that drive continuous improvement.**

**Three Core Metrics:**
1. **Escaped Defects Rate** - Quality gates catching issues before production
2. **Parallel Operation Duration** - Deployment timeline accuracy
3. **Rollback MTTR** - Recovery speed when needed

**Time Investment:** ~30 minutes per month  
**Value:** Data-driven framework improvements, risk calibration, process optimization

---

## Why These Metrics Matter

### For The Bridge Framework
- **Validate risk assessments** - Are HIGH RISK projects actually high risk?
- **Calibrate quality gates** - Which gates catch which types of issues?
- **Improve time estimates** - How long does parallel operation really take?
- **Measure safety net** - Can we rollback quickly when needed?

### For Small Company Reality
- **Lightweight** - Metrics collected during post-mortems (no extra overhead)
- **Actionable** - Clear thresholds trigger framework adjustments
- **Practical** - Focus on what matters for preventing catastrophic failures

### For Continuous Improvement
- **Pattern recognition** - Identify recurring issues early
- **Framework tuning** - Data-driven adjustments to protocols
- **Confidence building** - Track success rate over time

---

## Metric #1: Escaped Defects Tracking

### Definition

**Escaped Defect:** An issue that reached production despite passing through quality gates, OR was caught by a later gate when an earlier gate should have caught it.

**Purpose:** Measure quality gate effectiveness and identify gaps in review processes.

### Severity Classification

| Severity | Definition | Example |
|----------|------------|---------|
| **Critical** | Causes data loss, security breach, or business shutdown | Authentication bypass, data corruption |
| **High** | Significantly impacts operations or user experience | Critical workflow broken, major data inconsistency |
| **Medium** | Noticeable issue but workarounds exist | Performance degradation, minor data issue |
| **Low** | Minor cosmetic or usability issue | Typo in UI, non-critical warning message |

### Gate Assignment

**Which gate should have caught it?**

| Gate | Responsible For Catching |
|------|-------------------------|
| **Layer 0** | Wrong tool assignment, improper task sizing, missing chunking |
| **Layer 1** | Incorrect risk assessment, capacity mismatch, missing prerequisites |
| **Layer 2: Security Review** | Authentication bypass, SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, secrets exposure |
| **Layer 2: Data Safety Review** | Data corruption, transaction failures, missing validation, cascade issues |
| **Layer 2: Business Logic Review** | Workflow mismatches, edge cases, usability problems, integration failures |
| **Layer 3: Verification** | Insufficient testing, missing rollback plan, inadequate monitoring |

### Calculation Formula

**Escaped Defects Rate (EDR) by Gate:**

```
EDR_Gate = (Defects_Escaped_From_Gate / Total_Projects_Through_Gate) × 100%

Target: <5% for any single gate
Alert Threshold: ≥10% for any gate
```

**Severity-Weighted EDR:**

```
Weighted_EDR = (Critical × 10 + High × 5 + Medium × 2 + Low × 1) / Total_Projects

Target: <2.0 per project
Alert Threshold: ≥5.0 per project
```

### Tracking Template

**Create:** `ESCAPED_DEFECTS_LOG.md`

```markdown
# Escaped Defects Log

## Defect #[ID]: [Brief Description]
**Date Discovered:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Project:** [Name]
**Risk Level:** [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH]

**Severity:** [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
**Gate That Should Have Caught It:** [Layer X: Specific gate]

**Root Cause:**
[Why the gate missed it]

**Impact:**
- User impact: [Description]
- Business impact: [Description]
- Time to fix: [Hours]
- Rollback required: [YES/NO]

**Prevention:**
[What gate enhancement would have caught this]

**Framework Update:**
- [ ] Update gate checklist
- [ ] Add to edge case tests
- [ ] Update AI prompt templates
- [ ] Add to pattern library

**Galactica Log:**
```bash
memory remember "Escaped defect: [Project] - [Brief description]. Severity: [X]. Gate: [Y] should have caught. Prevention: [Z]" \
  --tags defect,layer-X,improvement \
  --importance 8
```
```

### Success Thresholds

| Metric | Target | Warning | Critical |
|--------|--------|---------|----------|
| Overall EDR | <5% | 5-10% | >10% |
| Critical Defects | 0 | 1 per quarter | 2+ per quarter |
| High Defects | <2 per quarter | 2-4 per quarter | >4 per quarter |
| Layer 2 EDR | <3% | 3-7% | >7% |
| Layer 3 EDR | <5% | 5-12% | >12% |

**Actions by Threshold:**
- **Target:** Framework working well, continue monitoring
- **Warning:** Review gate procedures, enhance weak areas
- **Critical:** Immediate framework review, consider external audit

---

## Metric #2: Parallel Operation Duration Tracking

### Definition

**Parallel Operation Duration:** Actual time spent running old and new systems together before full cutover, compared to planned duration.

**Purpose:** Improve deployment timeline estimates and identify risk-level patterns.

### Duration Standards by Risk Level

| Risk Level | Planned Duration | Typical Variance | Confidence Target |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **LOW** | None (direct deployment) | N/A | N/A |
| **MEDIUM** | 1-2 weeks | ±3 days | 80% within range |
| **HIGH** | 1 month (4 weeks) | ±1 week | 80% within range |

### Calculation Formulas

**Duration Variance:**
```
Variance_Days = Actual_Duration - Planned_Duration
Variance_Percentage = (Variance_Days / Planned_Duration) × 100%

Target: Within ±20% of planned
Warning: ±20% to ±40%
Critical: >±40%
```

**Confidence Interval (after 5+ projects per risk level):**
```
Mean_Duration = Σ(Actual_Durations) / N_Projects
Std_Dev = √(Σ(Actual - Mean)² / N_Projects)

80% Confidence Range = Mean ± 1.28 × Std_Dev
```

### Tracking Template

**Add to POST_MORTEM_TEMPLATE.md (Section 3):**

```markdown
## Parallel Operation Metrics

**Risk Level:** [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH]

**Planned Duration:** [X weeks/days]
**Actual Duration:** [Y weeks/days]
**Variance:** [Y - X days] ([Percentage]%)

**Start Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Full Cutover Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

**Factors Affecting Duration:**
- [ ] More discrepancies than expected
- [ ] Staff training took longer
- [ ] Integration issues discovered
- [ ] Business requirements changed
- [ ] External dependencies delayed
- [ ] Other: [Describe]

**Key Milestones:**
- Zero discrepancies first achieved: [Day X of parallel operation]
- Staff comfort level acceptable: [Day Y of parallel operation]
- Stakeholder approval obtained: [Day Z of parallel operation]

**Lessons for Duration Estimation:**
[What would improve future estimates]
```

### Pattern Analysis

**Monthly Review Questions:**
1. Are MEDIUM RISK projects consistently running longer than 1-2 weeks?
2. Is there a common factor in projects that exceed planned duration?
3. Can we identify early warning signs a project will run long?
4. Should we adjust standard durations by risk level?

**Quarterly Calibration:**
- Calculate confidence intervals for each risk level
- Update deployment protocol duration estimates
- Document factors that reliably extend parallel operation

### Success Thresholds

| Metric | Target | Warning | Critical |
|--------|--------|---------|----------|
| Within Planned Range | >80% | 60-80% | <60% |
| Variance (MEDIUM) | ±3 days | ±4-7 days | >±7 days |
| Variance (HIGH) | ±7 days | ±8-14 days | >±14 days |
| Early Cutover (risky) | 0% | 1-5% | >5% |

**Early Cutover:** Proceeding to full deployment before meeting go-live criteria is tracked as a warning sign of protocol shortcuts.

### Example: Django SSO Project

**Risk Level:** HIGH (47/60)  
**Planned Duration:** 1 month parallel operation  
**Actual Duration:** N/A (direct deployment with thorough pre-deployment testing)  
**Notes:** HIGH RISK protocol followed with comprehensive testing, but no parallel operation phase. Future HIGH RISK authentication projects should include shadow mode deployment.

**Learning:** HIGH RISK authentication systems may need modified parallel operation approach (shadow mode + canary deployment rather than traditional parallel operation).

---

## Metric #3: Rollback MTTR (Mean Time To Restore)

### Definition

**Rollback MTTR:** Time elapsed from "decision to rollback" to "system fully restored and operational."

**Purpose:** Measure recovery speed and validate rollback procedures actually work under pressure.

### Target MTTR by Risk Level

| Risk Level | Target MTTR | Warning | Critical |
|-----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| **LOW** | <60 minutes | 60-120 min | >120 min |
| **MEDIUM** | <30 minutes | 30-60 min | >60 min |
| **HIGH** | <15 minutes | 15-30 min | >30 min |

**Rationale:** Higher risk = must recover faster because business impact is greater.

### Calculation Formula

**MTTR:**
```
MTTR = Σ(Rollback_Times) / N_Rollbacks

Target varies by risk level (see table above)
```

**Rollback Success Rate:**
```
Success_Rate = (Successful_Rollbacks / Total_Rollback_Attempts) × 100%

Target: 100%
Warning: 90-99%
Critical: <90%
```

**Components of Rollback Time:**
1. **Detection Time:** Recognizing issue requires rollback (should be <5 min)
2. **Decision Time:** Deciding to execute rollback (should be <2 min)
3. **Execution Time:** Running rollback procedure (varies by system)
4. **Verification Time:** Confirming system restored (should be <5 min)

### Tracking Template

**Create:** `ROLLBACK_LOG.md`

```markdown
# Rollback Event Log

## Rollback #[ID]: [Project Name]
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]
**Project:** [Name]
**Risk Level:** [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH]

**Timeline:**
- Issue detected: [HH:MM]
- Rollback decision: [HH:MM]
- Rollback initiated: [HH:MM]
- System restored: [HH:MM]
- Verification complete: [HH:MM]

**Total MTTR:** [Minutes]
- Detection time: [Minutes]
- Decision time: [Minutes]
- Execution time: [Minutes]
- Verification time: [Minutes]

**Rollback Trigger:**
- [ ] Data corruption
- [ ] Security vulnerability
- [ ] Critical functionality broken
- [ ] Performance unacceptable
- [ ] User cannot complete workflows
- [ ] Other: [Describe]

**Rollback Method:**
- [ ] Git revert + redeploy
- [ ] Restore from backup
- [ ] Cutover to old system
- [ ] Database rollback
- [ ] Other: [Describe]

**Success:**
- [ ] YES - System fully restored
- [ ] PARTIAL - Some functionality restored
- [ ] NO - Rollback failed

**If Failed or Delayed:**
[What went wrong with rollback procedure]

**Data Impact:**
- Data loss: [YES/NO - describe]
- Data integrity: [Maintained/Compromised]
- Recovery: [Complete/Partial/None]

**Business Impact:**
- Downtime: [Minutes]
- Users affected: [Count]
- Revenue impact: [If applicable]
- Reputation impact: [Assessment]

**Root Cause:**
[Why was rollback needed]

**Prevention:**
[What gate should have caught this]

**Rollback Procedure Improvement:**
[What would make rollback faster/more reliable]

**Galactica Log:**
```bash
memory remember "Rollback: [Project] - [Trigger]. MTTR: [X min]. Success: [Y/N]. Learning: [Z]" \
  --tags rollback,layer-3,incident \
  --importance 9
```
```

### Success Thresholds

| Metric | Target | Warning | Critical |
|--------|--------|---------|----------|
| Rollback Success Rate | 100% | 95-99% | <95% |
| HIGH Risk MTTR | <15 min | 15-30 min | >30 min |
| MEDIUM Risk MTTR | <30 min | 30-60 min | >60 min |
| LOW Risk MTTR | <60 min | 60-120 min | >120 min |
| Rollbacks per Quarter | <2 | 2-4 | >4 |

**Zero Rollbacks:** Not necessarily good if it means insufficient deployments or taking excessive risk by not having rollback capability.

**Frequent Rollbacks:** Indicates quality gates aren't working or deployments proceeding with known issues.

### Rollback Drill Recommendation

**For HIGH RISK systems:**
- Test rollback procedure 3× before initial deployment
- Quarterly rollback drills (test in staging)
- Document actual execution time
- Update procedure based on drill results

**For MEDIUM RISK systems:**
- Test rollback procedure 1× before initial deployment
- Semi-annual rollback drills
- Verify documentation is current

**For LOW RISK systems:**
- Document rollback procedure
- Test if time permits
- No regular drills required

```

### 2. Trend Analysis (10 minutes)

**Compare to previous months:**

**Questions to ask:**
1. **Escaped Defects:**
   - Increasing or decreasing over time?
   - Which gates are weakest?
   - Are severity patterns changing?

2. **Parallel Operation:**
   - Are estimates getting more accurate?
   - Which risk level estimates need adjustment?
   - Common factors in extended durations?

3. **Rollback MTTR:**
   - Getting faster or slower over time?
   - Are drills improving execution speed?
   - Which rollback methods work best?

**Visual Trending (optional):**
- Simple line graph of EDR over time
- Bar chart of parallel operation variance by risk level
- Timeline of rollback events

### 3. Action Items (10 minutes)

**Framework Updates Needed:**

**If EDR >5% overall:**
- [ ] Review specific gate procedures
- [ ] Update gate checklists
- [ ] Enhance AI prompt templates
- [ ] Add to edge case tests

**If parallel operation variance >±40%:**
- [ ] Adjust standard durations in protocols
- [ ] Update capacity planning estimates
- [ ] Document common delay factors
- [ ] Revise go-live criteria

**If MTTR exceeds targets:**
- [ ] Test rollback procedures
- [ ] Update rollback documentation
- [ ] Schedule rollback drills
- [ ] Simplify rollback process

**If multiple metrics at warning/critical:**
- [ ] Schedule comprehensive framework review
- [ ] Consider external audit/consultation
- [ ] Revisit risk assessment approach
- [ ] Evaluate if taking on too much complexity

**Document action items:**
```bash
# Log to Galactica
memory remember "Monthly metrics review [Month Year]: [Key findings and action items]" \
  --tags metrics,review,action-items \
  --importance 7
```

### 4. Success Patterns

**Also track what's working well:**
- Which gates are consistently catching issues?
- Which risk assessments are most accurate?
- Which protocols are easiest to follow?
- Which AI tools are performing best?

**Amplify successes:**
- Document successful patterns in pattern library
- Share lessons across similar projects
- Calibrate confidence in proven approaches

## Integration with Existing Framework

### POST_MORTEM_TEMPLATE.md Enhancements

**Add to Section 3 (Framework Effectiveness):**

```markdown
### Metrics Data Collection

**Escaped Defects (if any):**
- [ ] NO defects escaped to production
- [ ] YES - Document in ESCAPED_DEFECTS_LOG.md

**Parallel Operation Duration (if applicable):**
- Planned: [X weeks/days]
- Actual: [Y weeks/days]
- Variance: [Z%]
- Within target range: [YES/NO]

**Rollback Events (if any):**
- [ ] NO rollback required
- [ ] YES - Document in ROLLBACK_LOG.md
- MTTR: [X minutes]
- Success: [YES/NO]
```

### Galactica Integration

**Standard logging commands:**

```bash
# After post-mortem
memory remember "[Project]: Metrics - EDR: [X], Duration variance: [Y%], Rollback: [Z]" \
  --tags metrics,project-outcome \
  --importance 6

# Monthly review
memory remember "Monthly review [Month Year]: [Key findings]" \
  --tags metrics,monthly-review \
  --importance 7

# Trend identification
memory remember "Metric trend: [Which metric] showing [pattern] over [timeframe]" \
  --tags metrics,trend,pattern \
  --importance 7
```

### Layer 4 (Learning Loop) Connection

**Metrics inform framework improvements:**
1. Post-mortem captures metrics data
2. Monthly review identifies trends
3. Trends trigger framework updates
4. Updates tested on next projects
5. Metrics validate improvements

**Feedback loop:**
```
Metrics → Trends → Improvements → Testing → Validation → Updated Metrics
```

### Automated Collection Opportunities

**Low-hanging fruit for automation:**

1. **Galactica queries** - Already automated via CLI
2. **Post-mortem aggregation** - Use grep/search on markdown files
3. **Timeline tracking** - Git commit timestamps for deployment events
4. **Rollback timing** - If deployment logs available, can extract timestamps

**Future enhancements:**
- Simple script to aggregate post-mortem data
- Dashboard generation from Galactica queries
- Alert triggers for threshold breaches

**For now:** Manual collection during post-mortems is sufficient for monthly 30-min review.

## Examples & Calculations

### Example 1: Django SSO Project

**Project:** Django SSO Authentication System  
**Risk Level:** HIGH (47/60)  
**Timeline:** October 2025

#### Escaped Defects: None
- **Total Defects Escaped:** 0
- **EDR Contribution:** 0%
- **Severity-Weighted:** 0
- **Gate Performance:** All gates effective

**Analysis:** HIGH RISK protocol worked as designed. Three-perspective review caught issues before deployment.

#### Parallel Operation Duration: N/A
- **Planned:** Not applicable (direct deployment chosen)
- **Actual:** 0 days
- **Note:** Modified approach for authentication system - comprehensive pre-deployment testing instead of traditional parallel operation

**Learning:** HIGH RISK authentication systems may benefit from shadow mode + canary deployment rather than full parallel operation.

#### Rollback Events: None
- **Rollback Required:** NO
- **MTTR:** N/A
- **Rollback Plan:** Documented and available, not needed

**Analysis:** Clean deployment validates thorough pre-deployment process.

### Example 2: Hypothetical MEDIUM Risk Repair Ticketing System

**Project:** Repair Ticketing System (hypothetical)  
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM (35/60)  
**Timeline:** November 2025

#### Escaped Defects: 1 Medium Severity

**Defect:** Mobile view cut off submit button  
**Severity:** Medium (workaround: use desktop)  
**Gate That Should Have Caught It:** Layer 2 - Business Logic Review  
**Where Caught:** Week 1 of parallel operation

**Calculation:**
- Total projects this month: 2
- Defects escaped: 1
- EDR: (1/2) × 100% = 50% 🔴 **CRITICAL**
- Severity-weighted: (0×10 + 0×5 + 1×2 + 0×1) / 2 = 1.0 ✅ **ACCEPTABLE**

**Action:** Review Layer 2 Business Logic gate checklist, add mobile responsiveness testing requirement.

#### Parallel Operation Duration: Extended

**Planned:** 1-2 weeks  
**Actual:** 16 days (2.3 weeks)  
**Variance:** +2-9 days, or +14% to +64%

**Factors:**
- Staff training took 3 extra days
- Integration with supplier database had 2 issues discovered
- Business owner wanted additional validation period

**Calculation:**
```
Variance = 16 - 14 (midpoint) = +2 days
Percentage = (2/14) × 100% = +14% ✅ WITHIN TARGET (±20%)
```

**Learning:** MEDIUM RISK operational systems may need extra staff training time built into estimates.

#### Rollback Events: 1 Successful

**Event:** Discovery of mobile UI issue triggered brief rollback discussion  
**Decision:** Continue with parallel operation, fix during that period  
**MTTR:** N/A (decided not to rollback)

**Learning:** Parallel operation caught issue before full cutover, validating the protocol.

### Example 3: Quarterly Trend Analysis

**Quarter:** Q4 2025 (Oct-Dec)  
**Projects Completed:** 5 total

| Project | Risk | EDR | Duration Var | Rollbacks |
|---------|------|-----|--------------|-----------|
| Django SSO | HIGH | 0% | N/A | 0 |
| Repair Ticketing | MED | 50% | +14% | 0 |
| Employee Time-Off | LOW | 0% | N/A | 0 |
| Dashboard Update | LOW | 0% | N/A | 0 |
| Barge Tracker | MED | 0% | +8% | 0 |

**Aggregate Metrics:**

**EDR:**
- Overall: (0+1+0+0+0) / 5 = 0.2 defects per project
- Rate: 20% (1 of 5 projects had escaped defect) 🟡 **WARNING**
- Severity-weighted: 1.0/5 = 0.4 ✅ **GOOD**

**Duration Variance (MEDIUM projects only):**
- Repair Ticketing: +14%
- Barge Tracker: +8%
- Average: +11% ✅ **WITHIN TARGET (±20%)**

**Rollbacks:**
- Total: 0 ✅ **EXCELLENT**
- Success rate: N/A

**Quarterly Assessment:** ✅ **FRAMEWORK PERFORMING WELL**
- Only 1 escaped defect (medium severity, caught in parallel operation)
- Duration estimates accurate
- Zero production rollbacks
- Continue current protocols

## The Bottom Line

**Metrics exist to improve the framework, not to grade performance.**

**Use metrics to:**
- Identify weak gates and strengthen them
- Calibrate time estimates accurately
- Validate rollback procedures work
- Build confidence in proven patterns
- Make data-driven framework improvements

**Don't use metrics to:**
- Punish failures (they're learning opportunities)
- Create busy work (30 min/month maximum)
- Paralyze decision-making (metrics inform, humans decide)
- Replace judgment (context always matters)

**The goal:** Continuous improvement through lightweight, actionable measurement.
